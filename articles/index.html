                        Organic Harvests Digital (OHD) is a climate action and community reinvestment organization. The company focuses on adapting hardwares and internet of things (IoT) technology to solve the issues of food sustainability and promoting equity in tech and farming.
                        <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        OHD is centered on supporting climate-vulnerable communities while working to combat the complex sets of underlying determinants in health, safety, and economics that place the most vulnerable and marginalized at risk. In shaping climate informed citizens, OHD provides climate, programmatic workshops and trainings coupled with the community reinvestments projects to deliver value.

                    <h1 class="companyHeadline">Plenty</h1>
                    <p class="companyInfo">
                        Plenty is a startup that's becoming a household name as they sell their green at stores near you! Similar to OHD, Plenty believes that "indoor vertical farms create the perfect environment for plants, reducing the unpredictability of changing climates. No bleach, no pesticides on our plants. No GMOs. Just pure food that tastes like nature intended."

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They seek to grow fresh leafy greens and join OHD's movement of innovating commercial farming tactics by standardizing large vertical farms. They currently have large vertical farm ecosystems in the South San Francisco area and are continuously moving forward to place more farms in areas like Compton where they will provide both jobs and access to fresh foods.

                    <h1>Gotham Green's</h1>
                    <p class="companyInfo">
                        Last, but not least Gotham Green's is another company specializing in indoor farming system to reclaim traditional farm land. In the process of becoming a B-Corp, a legal entity with a focus on sustainability and the environment, they were able to reveal incredibly powerful figures regarding how their produce is distributed.

                        "We grow incredibly fresh produce"

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        They found that their company provides at least 75% of their greens to customers within 50 miles of their regional growing facilities. This could mean that Gotham Green's can directly address food deserts and scarcity by placing their growing facilities in areas without access to produce.
